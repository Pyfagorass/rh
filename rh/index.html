                        The Riemann Hypothesis is one of the great unsolved problems of
                        mathematics and the reward of $1,000,000 of <a target="_new" href="http://www.claymath.org/">Clay Mathematics
                        Institute</a> prize money awaits the person who solves it. But-with
                        or without money-its resolution is crucial for our understanding of
                        the nature of numbers.
</p>
                        <p>There are several full-length books recently published, written
                            for a general audience, that have the Riemann Hypothesis as their main
                            topic.  A reader of these books will get a fairly rich picture of the
                            personalities engaged in the pursuit, and of related mathematical and
                            historical issues.
                        </p>

                        <p>This is <i> not</i> the mission of the book that you now have before
                            you. We aim-instead-to explain, in as direct a manner as
                            possible and with the least mathematical background required, what
                            this problem is all about and why it is so important.
