The Riemann Hypothesis is one of the great unsolved problems of
mathematics and the reward of $1,000,000 of <a target="_new" href="http://www.claymath.org/">Clay Mathematics
  Institute</a> prize money awaits the person who solves it. But-with
or without money-its resolution is crucial for our understanding of
the nature of numbers.

<p>There are at least four full-length books recently published, written
for a general audience, that have the Riemann Hypothesis as their main
topic.  A reader of these books will get a fairly rich picture of the
personalities engaged in the pursuit, and of related mathematical and
historical issues.
     
<p>This is <i> not</i> the mission of the book that you now have before
you. We aim-instead-to explain, in as direct a manner as
possible and with the least mathematical background required, what
this problem is all about and why it is so important.
