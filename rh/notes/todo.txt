Barry write: 

[ ] explicit formula
[ ] introduction (overview of book)
[ ] chapter 28
[ ] skewes # endnote
[ ] multiplicities
[ ] chapter 30
[ ] epilogue: gaussian primes

Me: 

[ ] first -- reorganization of parts
[ ] move my compute stuff to epilogues
[ ] "Riemann Spectrum" (and is this standard terminology?)
[ ] find or generate the missing plots
[ ] make small corrections
[ ] fix fig_phihat_even_all -- need odlyzko database; figures seem too close.
    I should just include all the zeros needed in code.sage, to not depend on odlyzko!
[ ] move all code for book from psage to patch to the sage library and change
    the endnote "If you would like to replicate
    the computations, visit \url{http://sagenb.org} or install Sage
    and the purplesage Python package, which is available here
    \url{http://code.google.com/p/purplesage/}.  The code for the book
    is all in \verb|psage/rh/mazur_stein|."
