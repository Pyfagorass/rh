``The Riemann hypothesis is the central problem and it implies many,
many things. One thing that makes it rather unusual in mathematics
today is that there must be over five hundred papers---somebody should
go and count---which start `Assume the Riemann hypothesis,' and
the conclusion is fantastic. And those [conclusions] would then become
theorems ... With this one solution you would have proven five hundred
theorems or more at once.''

Consider the seemingly innocuous series of questions:

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\item How many primes  (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, $\ldots$) are there less than 100?
\item How many less than 10,000?
\item How many less than 1,000,000?
\end{itemize}

More generally, how many primes are there less than any given number $X$?
\end{quote}

Riemann's Hypothesis tells us that a strikingly
simple-to-describe function is a ``very good approximation'' to the number of
primes less than a given number $X$. We now
see that if we could prove this {\em Hypothesis of Riemann} we would have
the key to a wealth of powerful mathematics. Mathematicians are eager
to find that key.

Raoul Bott, once
said---giving advice to some young mathematicians---that whenever one
reads a mathematics book or article, or goes to a math lecture, one
should aim to come home with something very specific (it can be small,
but should be {\em specific}) that has application to a wider class of
mathematical problem than was the focus of the text or lecture. 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Setting the frame}
 If we
were to suggest some possible {\em specific} items to come home with,
after reading our book, three key phrases -- {\bf prime numbers}, {\bf
  square-root accurate}, and {\bf spectrum} -- would head the
list.

to be the number of pairs of {\em consecutive} primes $(p,q)$ with
$q<X$ that have ``gap $k$'' (i.e., such that their difference $q-p$ is
$k$).

For example, $\Gap_2(10) = 2$, since the pairs
$(3,5)$ and $(5,7)$ are the pairs less than $10$ with gap $2$,
and $\Gap_{4}(10)=0$ because despite $3$ and $7$ being separated
by $4$, they are not consecutive primes.\end{frame}

There are 455,052,512 primes less than ten billion; i.e.,
10,000,000,000 (so we might say that the chances are down to roughly
$1$ in $22$).

Primes, then, seem to be thinning out.  We return to the sifting process
we carried out earlier, and take a look at a few graphs, to get a sense of why
that might be so. There are a $100$ numbers less than or equal to
$100$, a thousand numbers less than or equal to $1000$, etc.: the
shaded graph in Figure~\ref{fig:sieve_2_100} that looks like a regular staircase, each step the
same length as each riser, climbing up at, so to speak, a 45 degree
angle, counts all numbers up to and including~$X$.

\end{document}
 The recent results of Zhang as sharpened by Maynard (and others) we mentioned above tell us that for  at least one even number $k$ among the  even numbers $k \le 252$,    $\Gap_{k}(X)$ goes to infinity as $X$ goes to infinity. One expects that this happens for {\it all} even numbers $k$. We expect this as well, of course, for $\Gap_{252}(X)$ despite what might be misconstrued as discouragement by the above data.

  Challenge: As $X$ tends to infinity which of $\Gap_2(X)$,
  $\Gap_4(X)$,
  $\Gap_6(X),$ or $\Gap_8(X)$ do you think will grow faster? How
  much would you bet on the truth of your guess? \bibnote{%
    Hardy and Littlewood give a nice conjectural answer to such
    questions about gaps between primes.  See Problem {\bf A8} of
    Guy's book {\em Unsolved Problems in Number Theory} (2004).
Note that Guy's book discusses counting the number $P_k(X)$ of pairs of
primes up to $X$ that differ by a fixed even number $k$; we have
$P_k(X)\geq \Gap_k(X)$, since for $P_k(X)$ there is no requirement
that the pairs of primes be consecutive.}
