## Cover

Lots of people don't like certain technical details about the cover:

> when I see that cover I can't help but make an aesthetic objection: Why couldn't the designer just let the Zeta function's own, perfectly beautiful form do it's thing? Why artificially insert the sharp red border on it like that? The 'natural border' of this region of the function would do perfectly well by itself... It seems like a gorgeous design concept that lost something during execution. Still not bad looking overall, but it could be much better!

> I also dislike the cover, just in case the future design takes ideas from this; the colours make it very difficult to read the title for me.

> As for the cover, go more minimalistic, stronger Zeta function colors and center the text in the red area.  Perhaps make the Zeta 1/3 of the total cover space. Drop the picture and blue wave and use a font with more geometric features (uniform element thickness throughout the characters' elements).
