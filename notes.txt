* GRH in cnt -- 
 That's interesting. I assume you mean the quotation:

"Consequently, an algorithm to compute Cl(K) via generators and
relations (currently the
only viable practical approach) either has to assume that GRH is true
or immediately
becomes exponential."


Yes, that's relevant to us.  Of course we can't use the phrase "Cl(K)
via generators and relations"  so we could say, in our book, for
example, that "(G)RH would assure us that some of the algorithms we
use compute things of essential importance in mathematics  will NOT be
exponential."   There is---a bit---the problem that it is GRH and not
RH, but there must be a way of signalling ---or at least
hinting---this without staying from our format too much(?)
